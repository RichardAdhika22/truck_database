## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This CPSC 304 project represents the schema of a logistics and transportation company. The database models the real-world operation of managing trucks, drivers, dispatchers, customer orders, and geographic locations such as garages, company offices and client buildings. The whole database is built around managing orders and each entity serves a purpose to provide detailed information on each order. The schema incorporates ISA through drivers and dispatchers, aggregation via driver-truck-order relationships, and interlinked tables like connecting which truck and drivers are out on an order or where from and to its going. The system also simulates how trucks are dispatched and parked, and how employees are organized across various work locations. It ensures integrity across all entities and enforces realistic constraints to reflect actual business logic.

Refer to the [ER Diagram](https://github.com/RichardAdhika22/truck_database/blob/main/milestones/CS304_milestone2-2.pdf) (a PDF file containing the diagram) to see the big picture of the database. Also, refer to the 'milestones' folder to view the written database relationships.
